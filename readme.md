# Vue Quiz

Your task will be to implement the `Quiz.vue` component. This component should provide a user interface based on the following description:

> Prompt the user with a series of multiple choice questions, one at a time, then provide a summary of how the user answered the questions.

- A button should be used to advance from one question to the next
- The user cannot advance to the next question without answering the current question
- Once a question has been answered, the user cannot revisit it
- The summary should display all questions and their respective answers in one view

Below are the relevant command line scripts to enable development:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the application with hot reloading
npm run serve
```
